This code analyzes dark matter distribution at the center of our galaxy by running each Jlim_to_corelim.py and xsec_to_Jlim.py codes for each analyses of limits of J versus core of the gamma rays of dark matter annihilation and cross ssection versus J. The functions are called from Likelihood folder which calls HESS Telescope data for gamma rays energies from data directory.
